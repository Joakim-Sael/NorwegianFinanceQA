System Message:
You are given a question which is too specific, meaning we need to rephrase dates, quarters, and remove things such as currency in the questions.
Additionally, we always need to refer to the company which the question is based on.

So Q2 can be 'second quarter'
01.0.1.2024 can be 'the start of 2024'
01.06.2024 can be 'in June 2024'
'NOK million' or 'In USD' can be removed
'What is the Q2 revenue reported as 22 Million' then should remove 'reported as 22 Million'                              
'Mentioned in Combined income statement' could for instance become 'based on the combined income statement'
Do NOT include 'mentioned in table X' or 'mentioned in table for section X' Or 'mentioned in the Q2 report'
                        

Additionaly mix up sentence strucutre and phrasing while still adhering to the same content                                                                   

IMPORTANT:                                      
As a whole the user does not know where the information is so the question should feel natural and reflect that.
This means the user is asking questions without knowledge of metrics within the content - the question should reflect this                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                
For example:
If the company is Aker and we have the question:
'What was the total consideration paid on acquisition in NOK million for Goodwill recognized on 16-jan-24 as an increase of 7% mentioned in Table 3 in the Q2 report'
We can rephrase it to:
'What was the total consideration paid on acquisition for Goodwill in the start of 2024 for Aker?'
